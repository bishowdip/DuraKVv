# moment, restart (recovery runs), and assert that *every key it acknowledged*
# (printed "COMMIT <key>" before death) is present afterwards and the store
# reopens cleanly. Across iterations the store keeps growing, so we also prove
# nothing previously committed is ever lost.
#
# Exit 0 = PASS, non-zero = a committed key vanished or the DB failed to open.
