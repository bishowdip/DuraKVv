/*
 * recovery.c -- crash recovery, a simplified form of the ARIES algorithm.
 *
 * Run once at startup, this brings the data file to a consistent state after a
 * crash by replaying the WAL in three passes:
 *
 *   1. ANALYSIS -- scan forward from the last checkpoint to learn which
 *      transactions COMMITTED (winners) and which were still in flight
 *      (losers), and the highest LSN/txn ids seen.
 *   2. REDO -- re-apply the after-image of every committed update, so all
 *      acknowledged work is present even if its data page never reached disk.
 *   3. UNDO -- restore the before-image of every uncommitted update, so a
 *      partially-applied loser transaction leaves no trace ("atomicity").
 *
 * The crucial property is IDEMPOTENCE: redo compares each page's stored
 * page_lsn against the record's lsn and re-applies only when page_lsn < lsn.
 * A page already carrying that change (page_lsn >= lsn) is skipped. This makes
 * recovery safe to crash *during* and re-run from scratch -- exactly why the
 * crashtest can kill the process repeatedly and never lose or double-apply
 * data. Because each record holds a full page image, redo/undo also transparently
 * repair a torn (half-written) page. See include/recovery.h.
